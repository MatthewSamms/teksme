<p>
<font size="2"> <b>HTTP Status code: 422 Unprocessable Entity</b>: means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions. 
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="2"> <b>HTTP Status code: 409 Conflict </b>: The client has provided a value whose semantics are not appropriate for the property.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="2"> <b>HTTP Status code: 400 Bad Request</b>: If the server receives XML that is not well-formed, then the server MUST reject the entire request with a 400 (Bad Request). Also, since processing XML submitted by an untrusted source may cause risks connected to privacy, security, and service quality, the server will reject questionable requests (even though they consist of well-formed XML).
