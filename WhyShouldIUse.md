## Why should I use TèksMe? ##

Here are a selection of the reasons:

  * Open Source Software - TèksMe is released under the Apache v 2.0 License.

  * Written in Java - TèksMe runs on any platform with a Java 5 or later runtime.

  * Flexibility - Build any application you want using any platform or any programming model.

  * Convenience, and ease of deployment - Ready to go. For example, if you want an e-mail account, you can sign up for Google’s gmail inside of five minutes and start sending and receiving e-mails immediately. Compare that to the time, cost and management expense of setting up and running your own server.

  * Cost/Return -  Minimize the upfront investments and high costs associated with the development and setup of messaging systems.
