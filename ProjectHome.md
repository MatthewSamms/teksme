## What is TèksMe? ##

TèksMe Cloud enables any application (web, desktop, mobile) on any device to communicate over multiple channels, such as SMS, email and IM using a single interface.

TèksMe is an open-source communication middleware that is housed in the cloud and allows virtually any application to send and receive messages to and from SMS, Email, Twitter, Facebook, etc via REST, and the platform will manage all of the requirements of any message- and/or voice-oriented system.

Even a small, fast-moving "two-pizza team" could add Voice, SMS, Twitter, and IM to their applications faster and easier.

<p><b>Note:</b> TèksMe is not yet fully available. At this stage, we have published some docs and are checking in code to the repository. Stay tuned for more information in the coming months. For now, you need an invitation to use TèksMe. Please <a href='Waitlist.md'>sign up</a> for the waitlist.<br>
